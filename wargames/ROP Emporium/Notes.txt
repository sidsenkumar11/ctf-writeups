Confirm protections on binaries:
    - rabin2 -I <binary>
    - checksec <binary>

Get Function Names
    - Imported from shared libraries
        - rabin2 -i <binary>
    - Only those written by programmer (approximation)
        - rabin2 -qs <binary> | grep -ve imp -e ' 0 '

If the binary isn't position independent, the previous step will also find the function locations.
Reading .got.plt entries tells you locations of imported functions.

Strings
    - rabin2 -z <binary>
    - Better than 'strings' utility since only yields strings programmer placed in binary

Pitfalls
-----------
/usr/bin/bash
    - calling system() incorrectly in GDB calls this binary.

Stack alignment may matter
Stack location may matter
    - If you pivot and place the chain in the .data section, you may not have infinite space before you start getting to non-writable memory.
